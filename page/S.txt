[SECTION] S
[HEADER]Sand filter
A packed-bed filter of sand or other granular materials used to provide advanced secondary treatment of settled wastewater or septic tank effluent. Sand/media filters consist of a lined (e.g., impervious PVC liner on sand bedding) excavation or structure filled with uniform washed sand that is placed over an under drain system. The wastewater is dosed onto the surface of the sand through a distribution network and allowed to percolate through the sand to the underdrain system, which collects the filtered effluent for further processing or discharge.   [sub header] Intermittent Sand Filter: a sand filter in which pre-treated wastewater is applied periodically providing intermittent periods of wastewater application, followed by periods of drying and oxygenation of the filter bed. 
[sub header] Recirculating Sand (Gravel) Filter: a sand (gravel) filter which processes liquid waste by mixing filtrate with incoming septic tank effluent and recirculating it several times through the filter media before discharging to a final treatment/disposal unit.  [sub header] Sand-Lined Drainfield Trench: a combination of a pressure distribution drainfield and an intermittent sand filter consisting of a two-foot layer of sand filter media placed directly below the drain rock layer in the pressure distribution drainfield trench.  
[HEADER]Sand mound
A sand mound is a sand filter constructed without containment and dispersing directly to a basal area of native soils.
[HEADER]Sanitary tee
Pipe configuration in the shape of a “T” with a long-sweep radius side arm.
[HEADER]Saprolite

[HEADER]Saturated soil
Condition wherein all available soil pore space is occupied by water.
[HEADER]Scarify
Scratching the infiltrative (or basal infiltrative) surface prior to installation of a final treatment and dispersal component.
[HEADER]Scum

[HEADER]Seasonal High Water Table (SHWT)
Upper limit of soil water table which persists for more than 20 consecutive or 30 total days during a year, as  determined by piezometer data combined with rainfall data, and/ or methods of soil and site assessment.  
[HEADER]Sediment
Fragmented organic or inorganic material derived from the weathering of soil, alluvial, and rock materials; removed by erosion and transported by water, wind, ice, and gravity.
[HEADER]Sedimentation
Settling of solid material out of a liquid, normally achieved by reducing the velocity of the liquid below the point at which it can transport the suspended material; this may be enhanced by coagulation and flocculation. Also termed settling.
[HEADER]Septage
The liquid, solid, and semisolid material that results from wastewater treatment in a septic tank, or treatment method which must be pumped, hauled, treated, and disposed of properly. 
[HEADER]Septic tank
A buried, watertight tank designed and constructed to receive and partially treat raw wastewater. The tank separates and retains settleable and floatable solids suspended in the raw wastewater. Settleable solids settle to the bottom to form a sludge layer. Grease and other light materials float to the top to form a scum layer. The removed solids are stored in the tank, where they undergo liquefaction in which organic solids are partially broken down into dissolved fatty acids and gases. Gases generated during liquefaction of the solids are normally vented through the building’s plumbing stack vent. 
[HEADER]Septic tank effluent pump (STEP)
Collection system that uses septic tanks and pumping systems and collects effluent to a common treatment facility using a pressure sewer (collector forcemain).
[HEADER]Sequencing batch reactor (SBR)

[HEADER]Sideslope (Sand mounds)
Slope of sand and cover soil fill.
[HEADER]Silt

[HEADER]Sludge
The accumulated solids and entrained water within a pretreatment component, generated during the biological, physical, or chemical treatment; coagulation; or clarification of wastewater.
[HEADER]Sludge return
Process that sends all or part of the material settled in a clarifier back to a septic or processing tank for further treatment.
[HEADER]Soil consistence
Attribute of soil expressed in degree of cohesion and adhesion, or in resistance to deformation or rupture. Consistence includes the resistance of soil material to rupture; resistance to penetration; and the manner in which the soil material behaves when subjected to compression.
[HEADER]Soil horizon
A layer of soil or soil material approximately parallel to the land surface and different from adjacent layers in physical, chemical, and biological properties or characteristics such as color, structure, texture, consistence, and pH. 
[HEADER]Soil map
A map showing the distribution of soil types or other soil mapping units in relation to the prominent physical and cultural features of the earth’s surface. 
[HEADER]Soil matrix
The portion of a given soil having the dominant colour, in most cases, the matrix will be the portion of the soil having more than 50 percent of the same colour.  May also be loosely used to mean the solid body of the soil, including the mineral soil particles and soil aggregates.
[HEADER]Soil morphology
